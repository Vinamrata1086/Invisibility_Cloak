Fascinate about the magical world of Harry Potter? Remember the **Invisibility Cloak** which Harry had?

Well, now you can have your own invisibility cloak. Here is the code to make an Invisible Cloak like Harry Potter had, using ***Python OpenCV***.

[OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/index.html) (Open Source Computer Vision Library) includes several computer vision algorithms.

### Algorithm Steps:
- Capture and archive the underlying frame
- Using color detection and segmentation algorithm to detect the given colour.
- Segment the colored component which is identified by creating a mask.
- To build a mystical effect produce the final enhanced production.
